# Daily-Planner-List

## Project
This project was about creating a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.

## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule.
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner.
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
In order for the 'Acceptance Criteria' to be met, the web application should be able to:

1. Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.
2. Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
3. Colour-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
4. Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.
5. Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock
6. Persist events between refreshes of a page

## Outcome
I successfully achieved the acceptance criteria, and with my code the web application is now able to:

1. Display the current day at the top of the calendar when the user opens the planner.
2. Present timeblocks for standard business hours from 9AM - 5PM when the user scrolls down.
3. Colour-code each timeblock based on past, future and present.
4. Allow user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.
5. Allow the user to save an event when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
6. Events saved on the planner still appear when the browser is refreshed.
